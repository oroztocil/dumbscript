# Dumbscript

This is a partial implementation of an interpreter for a simple JavaScript-like language I made while following [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

At some point, I intend to finish it and add some features not present in current JS (e.g. pipes and pattern matching).

## Script execution

```bash
deno run --allow-read ./src/main.ts ./src/scripts/script.ds
```
